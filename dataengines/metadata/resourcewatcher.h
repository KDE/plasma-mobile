     *
     * \brief Selectively monitor the nepomuk repository for changes.
     *
     * Resources may be monitored on the basis of types, properties, and uris.
     *
     * Changes may be monitored in one of the following ways:
     * -# By resources -
     *    Specify the exact resources that should be watched. Any changes made to the specified resources
     *    (Excluding \ref nepomuk_dms_metadata) will be notified through the propertyAdded() and propertyRemoved()
     *    signals. Notifications will also be sent if any of the watched resources is deleted.
     * -# By resources and properties -
     *    Specify the exact resources and their properties. Any changes made to the specified resources
     *    which touch one of the specified properties will be notified through the propertyAdded() and propertyRemoved()
     *    signals.
     * -# By types -
     *    Specific types may be specified via add/setType. If types are set, then notifications will be
     *    sent for all new resources of that type. This includes property changes and resource creation and removal.
     *    TODO: add flags that allow to only watch for resource creation and removal.
     * -# By types and properties -
     *    Both the types and properties may be specified. Notifications will be sent for property changes
     *    in resource with the specified types.
     *
     * \section nepomuk_rw_examples Resource Watcher Usage Example
     *
     * The following code creates a new ResourceWatcher, configures it to listen to changes on the \c nmm:performer
     * property on one specific resource \c res.
     *
     * \code
     * Nepomuk::ResourceWatcher* watcher = new Nepomuk::ResourceWatcher(this);
     * watcher->addResource(res);
     * watcher->addProperty(NMM:performer());
     * connect(watcher, SIGNAL(propertyAdded(Nepomuk::Resource, Nepomuk::Types::Property, QVariant)),
     *         this, SLOT(slotPropertyChanged()));
     * connect(watcher, SIGNAL(propertyRemoved(Nepomuk::Resource, Nepomuk::Types::Property, QVariant)),
     *         this, SLOT(slotPropertyChanged()));
     * rwatcher->start();
     * \endcode
